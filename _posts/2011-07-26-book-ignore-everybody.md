[Hugh MacLeod](http://twitter.com/#!/gapingvoid), above all else, is the perfect blend of inspirational and cynical. And the book is funny at the same time. In fact, this book is pretty genius. I like how it reads, how it feels while reading, how it&#8217;s organized, and what it leaves with you. The points in &#8220;Ignore Everybody&#8221; are more like solid life lessons than just keys to creativity. My detailed notes are just simply reminders, the big one liners that introduce each section&#8230; I absolutely recommend [his book](http://www.amazon.com/Ignore-Everybody-Other-Keys-Creativity/dp/159184259X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1311679592&sr=8-1) and [his site](http://www.gapingvoid.com).

1. **Ignore Everybody** &#8211; The more original your idea, the less good advice other people will be able to give you.
  
2. **The idea doesn&#8217;t have to be big. It just has to be yours.**
  
3. **Put the hours in**
  
4. **Good ideas have lonely childhoods**
  
5. **If your business plan depends on suddenly being &#8220;discovered&#8221; by some big shot, your plan will probably fail**
  
6. **You are responsible for your own experience** &#8211; Nobody can tell you if what you&#8217;re doing is good, meaningful, or worthwhile. The more compelling the path, the more lonely it is.
  
7. **Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten**
  
8. **Keep your day job** / The sex and cash theory
  
9. **Companies that squelch creativity can no longer compete with companies that champion creativity**
  
10. **Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb**
  
11. **The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props**
  
12. **Don&#8217;t try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether**
  
13. **If you accept the pain, it cannot hurt you**
  
14. **Never compare your inside with somebody else&#8217;s outside** &#8211; The more you practice your craft, the less you confuse wordly rewards with spiritual rewards, and vice versa. Even if your path never makes any money or furthers your career, that&#8217;s still worth a ton.
  
15. **Dying young is overrated**
  
16. **The most important thing a creative person can learn professionally is where to draw the red line that separates what you are willing to do from what you are not**
  
17. **The world is changing** &#8211; Some people are hip to it, others are not. If you want to be able to afford groceries in five years, I&#8217;d recommend listening closely to the former and avoiding the latter.
  
18. **Merit can be bought. Passon can&#8217;t**
  
19. **Avoid the water cooler gang**
  
20. **Sing in your own voice**
  
21. **The choice of media is irrelevant** &#8211; It&#8217;s the ability to express through it that matters&#8230;
  
22. **Selling out is harder than it looks** &#8211; Diluting your product to make it more &#8220;commercial&#8221; will just make people like it less
  
23. **Nobody cares. Do it for yourself.**
  
24. **Worrying about &#8220;Commercial vs. Artistic&#8221; is a complete waste of time.**
  
25. **Don&#8217;t worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually**
  
26. **You have to find your own shtick.**
  
27. **Write from the heart.** &#8211; There is no silver bullet. There is only the love God gave you.
  
28. **The best way to get approval is not to need it** &#8211; This is equally true in art and business. And love. And sex. And just about everything worth having.
  
29. **Power is never given. Power is taken.** &#8211; People who are &#8220;ready&#8221; give off a different vibe from people who aren&#8217;t. Animals can smell fear. And lack thereof.
  
30. **Whatever choice you make, the Devil gets his due eventually** &#8211; Selling out to Hollywood comes with a price. So does not selling out. Either way, you pay in full, and yes, it invariably hurts like hell.
  
31. **The hardest part of being creative is getting used to it**
  
32. **Remain frugal** &#8211; The less you can live on, the more chance your idea will succeed.
  
33. **Allow your work to age with you**
  
34. **Being Poor Sucks** &#8211; The biggest mistake young people make is underestimating how competitive the world is out there.
  
35. **Beware of turning hobbies into Jobs** &#8211; It sounds great, but there is a downside.
  
36. **Savor obscurity while it lasts** &#8211; Once you &#8220;make it&#8221;, your work is never the same.
  
37. **Start blogging**
  
38. **Meaning scales, people don&#8217;t** &#8211; The size of the endeavor doesn&#8217;t matter as much as how meaningful it becomes to you.
  
39. **When your dreams become reality, the are no longer dreams** &#8211; Reality never looks just as you expected it in your dreams.
  
40. **None of this is rocket science** &#8211; Work hard, Keep at it. Live simply and quietly. Remain humble. Stay positive. Create your own luck. Be nice. Be polite.
