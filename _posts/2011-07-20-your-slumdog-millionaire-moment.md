Remember Jamal&#8217;s fateful run on &#8220;Who Wants to be a Millionaire&#8221; in the movie [Slumdog Millionaire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/)? Through a force beyond coincidence, Jamal&#8217;s experiences aligned perfectly with the questions before him. Your own next step in life might be the one that calls on all the unique experiences you&#8217;ve had. If that seems like a stretch, perhaps you should guarantee that it won&#8217;t be a stretch. We all have special knowledge, talents, and ways we&#8217;ve spent our time over the years. Why not try our hardest to find ourselves in a position to use it? What would your &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire Moment&#8221; look like?
