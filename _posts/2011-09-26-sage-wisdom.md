> Good programming is not learned from generalities, but by seeing how significant programs can be made clean, easy to read, easy to maintain and modify, human-engineered, efficient, and reliable, by the application of common sense and good programming practices. Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better writing. 

Sage wisdom from [Kernighan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_W._Kernighan) and [Plauger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Plauger).
