In the beginning, you just have to go ahead. Before that fateful first day of existence as we know it, I figure God probably sat around with a team of angels, all with degrees in engineering, and considered a lot of options. Or, since the angels might not have been there yet, He probably at least white boarded something. And soon after He realized that He could just create a ball of rock and the expanse for it. Ok, version one released. Release soon, revise soon. And then there was light. And it was good. And eventually you get Man, the &#8220;Killer App&#8221; for Earth (pun intended). And so in the spirit of &#8220;create and iterate&#8221;, I&#8217;ve started my blog.
