Work is the exercise of our ability to interact with the world, in a way that holds much of the best aspects of life. Work provides a context for a person to perform and strive to do well. Work is, in its best form, a contribution to society. Work doesn&#8217;t always mean a traditional nine to five either, what I mean by work is effort.

Wisdom is elusive. It&#8217;s like a combination of good natured principles mixed with confidence. Because confidence fluctuates, sometimes it feels like wisdom does as well. Wisdom is ironic, in that you can study it and strive towards it with no end (an important part about wisdom), but at the heart it is not complex philosophical knowledge. Wisdom is founded on fundamentals, principles. It&#8217;s akin to a golf putt, or playing bass guitar: easy to learn, hard to master.

Faith is what Napoleon Hill calls &#8220;the eternal elixir which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought.&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard it referred to as The Law of Attraction in scientific words. I think it has something to do with your subconscious brain. It changes your world, through belief. If it&#8217;s strong enough, it might be mistaken for clairvoyance. But it&#8217;s also about surrender to the spirit, both within and all around you.
