>  He was going to be all that a mortal should be<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
>  <br />
>  No one should be kinder or braver than he<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
>  <br />
>  A friend who was troubled and weary he knew,<br />
>  Who&#8217;d be glad of a lift and who needed it, too;<br />
>  On him he would call and see what he could do<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
> <br />
>  Each morning he stacked up the letters he&#8217;d write<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
>  <br />
>  And thought of the folks he would fill with delight<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
>  <br />
>  It was too bad, indeed, he was busy today,<br />
>  And hadn&#8217;t a minute to stop on his way;<br />
>  More time he would have to give others, he&#8217;d say<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
> <br />
>  The greatest of workers this man would have been<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
> <br />
>  The world would have known him, had he ever seen<br />
>  Tomorrow.<br />
>  <br />
>  But the fact is he died and he faded from view,<br />
>  And all that he left here when living was through<br />
>  Was a mountain of things he intended to do<br />
>  Tomorrow. <br />
