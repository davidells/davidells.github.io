I can&#8217;t get the ringing of this poem out of my ears.

> 
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was going to be all that a mortal should be
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one should be kinder or braver than he
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A friend who was troubled and weary he knew,
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who&#8217;d be glad of a lift and who needed it, too;
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On him he would call and see what he could do
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each morning he stacked up the letters he&#8217;d write
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thought of the folks he would fill with delight
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was too bad, indeed, he was busy today,
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hadn&#8217;t a minute to stop on his way;
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More time he would have to give others, he&#8217;d say
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest of workers this man would have been
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world would have known him, had he ever seen
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the fact is he died and he faded from view,
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all that he left here when living was through
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was a mountain of things he intended to do
  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow.
