Above \*all else\* is execution. Execution is everything. Ideas are wonderful. Books are great. Plans are important. Execution trumps them all. Your thoughts will guide your actions, but without actions, that guidance is futile. Get used to the feeling of execution. Put it at the top of your goals, principles, lists, whatever.
