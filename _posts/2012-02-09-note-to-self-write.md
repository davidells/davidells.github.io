This is what I say: &#8220;Writing gives you a way to practice the art of capturing the essence of ideas and information and turning it into concrete communication in the form of words. It&#8217;s great and everyone should do it.&#8221;

This is what I do: I don&#8217;t write.

This has to change. Think about the wonderful benefits that come from writing. They are all instrinsic. Anyone who thinks only about writing for some other reader when writing is missing the real value. The real value is comprehension, order of thought, and a canvas to exercise creativity. Writing is like language practice, and who can&#8217;t benefit from being a better communicator? Seriously! 

I&#8217;m reading a book about the Dalai Lama called &#8220;The Open Road&#8221; by Pico Iyer, and from reading Pico&#8217;s account of the man, I get the sense that the Dalai Lama&#8217;s challenge, and talent, is being able to communicate in a way that is both compelling and accessible, to people who dot the world&#8217;s spectrum of poverty and privilege and political power. 

The point being that even who we see as great humans see many things as neverending struggles. The Dalai Lama continues to strive for finding new and better ways to communicate, from the basic to technical levels. This is important for us all!

Writing translates into perspective. Otherwise, you just have feelings. But perspective is a clearer image. Writing is like taking the image in your head and actually sketching it on paper. It is a challenge that takes effort, and accepts effort. 

Now, inspiration&#8230; Inspiration is a wonderful word. It&#8217;s one of my top ten favorite words. Inspiration. Who can say no to that word?!
