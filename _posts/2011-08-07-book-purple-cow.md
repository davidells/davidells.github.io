As consumers we&#8217;ve gotten terribly good at ignoring and avoiding advertising. We also have arguably more choice then ever. So what gets your attention? A friend&#8217;s recommendation. An offer compelling and useful enough to mention. That&#8217;s the Purple Cow.

In his book [&#8220;Purple Cow&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-Transform-Business-Remarkable/dp/159184021X), [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/) outlines a manifesto that the best marketing choice available is to make a product or service remarkable (as remarkable as a purple cow), and this type of marketing is built right into the product. In short, **creating a remarkable product is the marketing** in today&#8217;s world. 

Godin&#8217;s core point is that &#8220;marketing&#8221; should focus not on mass media advertising but holistically on every aspect of the product, from the customer to the design to the production to the message, to create a remarkable product that will target a key group of early adopters who will share your product with others. This strategy also implies a key feature of your product and message, it should be [easy to share](http://davidells.info/blog/2011/07/succinct-is-good/). 

Godin also talks about the value of consumers with [&#8220;otaku&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku). The fanatics, the obsessed. The least risky thing one can do, which many major corporations might see as the most risky, is to target this smaller group of enthusiasts instead of the general public. This is because targeting the general public directly can only be done through mass media, which he&#8217;s outlined as useless. You can only target them indirectly (if at all) through the enthusiasts who will disseminate your remarkable product to them.
