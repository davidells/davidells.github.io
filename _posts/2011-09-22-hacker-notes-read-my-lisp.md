I just finished [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)&#8216;s canonical introduction to Common Lisp, creatively titled [ANSI Common Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/ANSI-Common-LISP-Paul-Graham/dp/0133708756/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1316661956&sr=8-1). 

It was bittersweet, because I really enjoyed going through it. Though I&#8217;ve flirted with lisp code many times, this is the first time it has really stuck with me as &#8216;an experience&#8217;, on the way to &#8216;getting it&#8217;.

I don&#8217;t think those phrases are (always) elitist nonsense anymore. You really can write beautiful, elegant, and concise code with lisp that is hard, or impossible, to parallel in another language. I find that having its capability and style at hand makes striving for that beauty addictive. And definitely fun.

I published my answers to many of the exercises from the book to my github account under [graham-ansi-common-lisp](https://github.com/davidells/graham-ansi-common-lisp). Just there for reference. If you have any comments, questions, alternative solutions, or just want to agree with me that lisp is awesome, give me a shout!
