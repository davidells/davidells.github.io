I keep a sorted collection of things in a digital notebook called, of all things, [TiddyWiki](http://www.tiddlywiki.com/). One of the first things I added to it was a list of values. So, here&#8217;s a not so random page out of my offline journal. It&#8217;s impossible to say a list of this kind is complete. This one in particular is still in its infancy. An interesting thing to add to a list like this is your Anti-Values. Calling out what you stand against implies what you stand for, and gives you a blacklist of feelings to fight, which is good if you&#8217;re in a fighting mood that day.

### Values

  * **Self Esteem** &#8211; Step one is caring for yourself, and respecting yourself enough to care. It&#8217;s actually core to survival.
  * **Friendship** &#8211; Good friendship is built on respect and mutuality. You must admire your friends, in at least some way.
  * **Humor** &#8211; An absolute necessity. You might get by without some other things on this list, but life is nothing without a sense of humor.
  * **Persistence** &#8211; It&#8217;s an endurance sport. It matters on day 1049 way more than on day 1.
  * **Candor** &#8211; Honesty is the path to freedom. To be vulnerable and candid is to be relatable.
  * **Practicality** &#8211; Because life is short, do what works and be on with it.
  * **Independence** &#8211; Because we are in the best position to contribute when we are independent.
  * **Courage** &#8211; The ability to see through the false fears you&#8217;ve created for yourself, or at least to stubbornly go ahead regardless of them.
  * **Determination** &#8211; The bridge between your desires and reality. The force backing your ability to affect reality.
  * **Resilience** &#8211; Low points are a fact. Resilience is the answer.
  * **Fun** &#8211; Yes, it is a value, a moral!
  * **Family** &#8211; Whether you&#8217;ve fallen from the tree or not, you are a branch of a tree, and are the root of another. If they are good, our longest relationships on this world are our best.

### Anti-Values

  * **Fear** &#8211; By far, the arch anti-value. It is the root of all evil, from which all other anti-values can be derived.
  * **Apathy** &#8211; Because life without emotion is not only bland, but empty.
  * **Laziness** &#8211; Doing nothing is an injustice to your potential, and disrespectful of the opportunity God has given you to do something with yourself. Not to be confused with rest.
  * **Selfishness** &#8211; It is shortsighted and narrow to think that your own immediate gain at the expense of others will outpace the long term gain of mutual benefit.
  * **Pride** &#8211; Its lure is perceived empowerment, but when things go bad, you&#8217;re left powerless with anger.
  * **Jealousy** &#8211; Completely useless. Doesn&#8217;t even serve a false utility like some other anti-values. Admire the talents, skills, and even luck of others for their unique qualities, instead of falsely hoping to copy them.

What are your values (or anti-values)?
