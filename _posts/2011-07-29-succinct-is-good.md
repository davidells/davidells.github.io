> &#8220;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.&#8221; Blaise Pascal &#8211; Provincial Letters: Letter XVI

From the the day to day ways you express yourself, all the way up to the purpose of your company, solution, service, blog, band, art, music, cause, or idea, remaining succinct is unarguably a good thing. But why? Not just because you look smart for compacting meaning. It&#8217;s because succinct is small, and small travels best (e.g. the [Mini Cooper](http://www.mini.com)!). Like [Geoffrey Moore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Moore) says about marketing, if you want to occupy a space in the head of your audience, you have to keep in mind that people aren&#8217;t willing to give up much space. Even if your idea is involved, if it doesn&#8217;t have a good tag-line, it&#8217;s like hitting the breaks. Usually it&#8217;s not the best idea that wins, but the idea that travels best.
