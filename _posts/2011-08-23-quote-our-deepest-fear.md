> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
  
> Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
  
> It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. 
> 
> We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?
  
> Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God.
  
> Your playing small doesn&#8217;t serve the world.
  
> There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won&#8217;t feel insecure around you. 
> 
> We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
  
> It is not just in some of us: it&#8217;s in everyone.
  
> And when we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
  
> As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
